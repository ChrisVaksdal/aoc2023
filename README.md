## Instructions: 
To run the solutions simply run `python3 aoc.py <day>` to get the answers for that day.
In order to download your inputs you need to set the `AOC_SESSION` environment variable (or download them manually into a file called `input.txt` for each day).
If you run the script on a day that does not exist, a folder with a stub python-script (based on `template.py`) and an empty test.txt will be generated for you.
